/*THIS IS A POEM*/

THE NAME OF THE POWER

I'm always thinking of you
the sea is blue and the sky to
your eyes bloe my pene
and your bobs take me crazy

Becouse you are beautiful!!!
my heart gooes faster and faster
.......................The moon is hig and the cloud are dark
My car stopped into the night 
nothing compares to you.
and a bird sing lalala

MYHEART

My heart goes boomm
I'am carol and I'am thinkin what to write
